# Political dashboard
For this project I was tasked with providing daily updates on undisclosed campaign ads for account management. I included several different metrics including total revenue spend, video starts, video completes, and completed engagements. These metrics I also broke out by many different dimensions such as date, placement name, audience, and geo (state). To break out metrics by audience, I used case statements to lump campaign metrics into specific audiences i.e republican, democrat, or swing. This dashboard was used as a reference for the duration of the campaign.
